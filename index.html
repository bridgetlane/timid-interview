<h2>Timid Interview</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a student who has to write a paper on organ recipients. In a room full of organ recipients and organ donors, you have to find and interview the recipients with only a limited amount of information about them. You have to interview 15 recipients! Try to interview the wrong one, and your embarrassment will cause you to forget your last interview.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience should be fun, quick, and maybe stressful.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual and find-it games
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
What you know about who you are looking for will flash in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Find the recipient! If you click on the wrong person, your patients interviewed count will go down by 1, because of your embarrassment (so embarrassed, you forgot who you interviewed last!). Look quickly, because when you interview the right patient, your next player's information will flash briefly. You can always get a hint, but you'll be so embarrassed for asking, you'll forget your last two interviews.
<br>
System dynamics: The character movements and appearances are random, and they move sporadically making the game unpredictable.<br>
Core mechanic: Clicking to collect interviews.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype evaluates sight and memory in a game.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
You never see yourself.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A room full of organ recipients and organ donors.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are a timid student who has to interview organ recipients in a room packed with organ recipients and donors. You have hints about the people you have to pick out of the crowd, but every time you get it wrong you get so embarrassed, you forget your last interview. If you forget all of your interviews and then some (have a score below zero), you'll be so embarrassed and flustered you just give up. Get all 15 needed interviews done to win.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Find-it gamers and people who like fast-paced memory games.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
5 minutes.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Understand where to look and the timing of things. For instance, the next clue appears in the upper-left hand corner immediately upon clicking on the right character. Look immediately in order not to miss it.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not model this game or take the game framework from any existing game or Phaser example. I did use Phaser documentation and many examples for many small parts of the game, such as learning how to set keypad controls.
